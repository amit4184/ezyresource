## **🎨 Step 3: Design Your Template**

In the Template Creator, you can add different elements:

### **📷 Add Photo Holders**

These are image boxes where users can add their own photos.

* Click on **Photo Holders**
* Choose a layout: square, portrait, or landscape
* Drag them onto the page

### **✍️ Add Text**

* Click **Text** or **Floating Text**
* Type something like “Your Title Here”
* Customize the font, size, color, alignment, bold or italic

💡 *Note: Emojis aren’t supported yet and will be ignored.*

### **🌈 Add Backgrounds**

* Click **Background**
* Pick a background image
* Or upload your own (.jpg format only)

⚠️ *Do not use CMYK images — they may show wrong colors when printed.*

### **🖼️ Add Clipart**

* Click **Clipart**
* Choose stickers to decorate your template
* You can upload your own transparent PNGs from the admin panel

## **🛠️ Step 4: Use Helpful Tools**

* **Lock/Unlock** – Prevent objects from moving
* **Duplicate** – Copy text or image holders
* **Bring Forward / Send Back** – Layer objects as needed
* **Crop** – Adjust photo framing

🧩 Gridlines help you align things perfectly — they appear automatically when moving objects close to each other.

## **💾 Step 5: Save & Preview**

* Click **Save** to save your design
* Click **Preview** to see how it looks (2D only for now)
* Click **Close** to return to the dashboard

3. Click the **Layout** button
4. Choose a new product size from the list (e.g., 6x6, 12x12)
5. A new tab will open — review the layout and make adjustments if needed
6. Click **Save**

🛠️ **Tip:** Always check spacing and alignments after resizing — some items may shift slightly.

1. On the Dashboard, click the gear/settings icon next to your template
2. Click **Publish**
3. Your template will now appear for users in the EzyDesigner tool!
