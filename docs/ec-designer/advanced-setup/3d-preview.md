## **How to Add 3D Preview**

### **Glossary:**

**glb file**
 The GLB format is a versatile and widely-used 3D file format.

**mesh**
 It refers to the collection of vertices, edges, and faces that defines the shape of a 3D object in space.

### **3D preview form will be displayed:**

There are three stages to add and test the 3D preview:

1. Upload 3D model
2. Configure the model
3. Test the 3D preview

### **Upload 3D Model**

After clicking on the 3D preview button, a form will be displayed:

* Upload the **.glb** file of the 3D model of the product
* **Note:**

  * It supports only **.glb** files
  * Upload .glb file **less than 10 MB**

### **Model Creation**

Model creation can be done by using any modelling software but we advise on using **Blender**. This should follow the rules and examples mentioned in the below doc:

You can also refer to editing mesh:

**Note:** These docs are created considering Blender for creating the model and UV mapping help.

The .glb file will upload and display:

* The glb file will upload and display the mesh details, the number of surfaces of the product, and the 3D model view.
* Select any mesh to see the mesh 3D modelÂ 
* Double click on mesh will show the whole 3D modelÂ 
* On the top of the form will show the product codeÂ 
* Close button - click on close button to close the 3D preview form 

### **To change mesh name and make it a printable surface, click on the Action button**

**Mesh Edit Form** will be displayed:

* **Mesh name** â€“ click on the field and edit the mesh name

  * **Note:** Space and special characters are not allowed
* **Customizable** â€“ enable it to make mesh customizable
* **Printable surface** â€“ select surface from the dropdown

  * **Note:** It will show surface name which is mentioned in the product configuration
* **Submit** â€“ click to submit the form
* **Close / Cancel** â€“ click to cancel the edit form

A 3D model will show along with the mesh list

### **Configure Scene**

After editing the mesh form, click on **Save and Next** to configure the model.
 In this stage, users can configure the model visibility and view. Initially, this form will be set with default values.

* **Background color** â€“ Â click on the background color and select any color to apply background color on 3D modelÂ 
* **Background image** â€“ click on upload image and add any image (PNG, jpeg)Â 

**Blur**:
 This option will appear only after the background image is uploaded. Users can blur the image by sliding the bar for a better 3D model view.

### **Default Camera Position**

The default camera position is the initial viewpoint from which the user sees the 3D model when the user first opens it.
 This X, Y, Z position is carefully chosen to provide the best overall view of the model.
 Click on **Edit** and add X, Y, Z position.

### **Auto Rotation**

Auto rotation is a feature that continuously rotates the 3D model on its own, allowing users to see the model from all angles without manually adjusting the view.

### **Ambient Light**

Ambient light in 3D models is a non-directional, background illumination that evenly lights up the scene, filling in shadows and revealing details.
 Both the **color** and the **intensity** of the light can be adjusted for a better view of the model.

### **Direction Lighting**

Directional light in 3D models is a light source that emits rays in a specific direction, creating shadows and highlights to define the shape and form of objects within the scene.
 Both the **color** and the **intensity** of the light can be adjusted for a better view of the model.

* **Back** â€“ click to change the .glb file and edit the printable surface
* **Save** â€“ click to save all the settings of the configuration
* **Cancel** â€“ click to close the configuration form

### **Testing the 3D Preview**

In this stage, all details of the model will show:
 e.g., Mesh name, Printable surface, and Customizable status.

For testing the 3D preview model:

* Click on **Upload image** and upload a preview image.
* The 3D model will reflect all the configuration settings with the applied image as the user has set.

### **Designer**

Open the 3D preview configured product on the designer, design the product, and click on **Preview**.
 This 3D preview will show as configured in the admin.

### **3D Preview of Canvas**

**Note:** The product has to be set to **3D** in product configuration for the 3D preview to be visible in the designer.

### **User Interactions**

**Rotation:**

* **Mouse**: Click and drag the left mouse button to rotate the model. This allows the user to view the model from different angles.
* **Touchscreen**: Use one finger to swipe and rotate the model.

**Zooming:**

* **Mouse**: Use the scroll wheel to zoom in and out.

**Touchscreen**: Pinch with two fingers to zoom in and out.
