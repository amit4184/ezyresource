title: Merch Product Flow
---
## **Overview**

This document outlines the steps to create a merchandise product in EzyCreate from start to finish. It includes definitions of key terminologies, preconditions, and a detailed, step-by-step process.

## **Key Terminologies**

* **Product Blank**: A foundational base item (e.g., mug, t-shirt) that includes only basic definitions such as dimensions and type. It does **not** include pricing, eCommerce configurations, templates, or designs.

  * Example: A standard 11oz mug with no associated template or sales info.
* **Product**: A market-ready version that includes all attributes necessary for selling, including pricing, eCommerce metadata, and at least one design template.
* **Product Types**:

  * **Customizable Product**: End users can personalize this using the design tool (e.g., add images, text).
  * **Merchandise Product**: Pre-designed product (e.g., branded merch) that may or may not allow image uploads.
* **Template**: A design layout applied to a product blank.
* **Template Group**: A collection of templates with similar designs, used to organize variants.
* **Variant**: A version of the product that varies by design, size, color, etc., within the same template group.
* **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: A unique identifier for each variant.
* **Merch Album**: A group of pre-uploaded images used in product customization.

### **3. Preconditions**

* The user is logged into the EzyAdmin. 
* The user has appropriate permissions to create/manage products.

**Section II: How to Create a thumbnail mockup.**

The Thumbnail feature is designed to make the process of creating preview images for templates faster and easier.

Currently, when a new template is created using the Template Designer, it doesn’t automatically generate a thumbnail (preview image). This means designers have to create these thumbnails manually and upload them to the store’s website, which takes time and effort.

With this feature, thumbnails will be automatically created for each template. This ensures every template has a high-quality preview image without needing manual work.

**Add the Thumbnail Mockup & Test the Preview**

1. Upload a mockup image – This is the base image where the design will appear (like a frame, mug, or canvas).
2. Draw the placeholder box – Mark the area where the customer’s design will go.
3. Add a mask shape – Define the shape and visibility of the design (to crop or blend naturally into the mockup).
4. Test the preview – Upload any sample image to check how it looks on the mockup. This ensures everything is aligned and works perfectly before proceeding.

**Select one product blank to add a product mockup**

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_1)


Click on 3 dots on the action and select the thumbnail preview setup

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_2)



A product mockup form will open and is divided into 4 steps 

1. Upload
2. Placeholder
3. Mask area
4. Test

Click on **choose file** and add a mockup image.  This is the base image where the design will appear (like a frame, mug, or canvas).


![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_3)


After uploading image, click on the  next button 

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_4)



After uploading your mockup image, it will load along with the placeholder box tools.

This placeholder box defines where the user's design will appear on the mockup 

You can adjust:

* **Position** – move the box around the image
* **Rotation** – rotate the box along X, Y, and Z axes
* **Zoom** – resize the box without changing the mockup image
  ***Note:** The placeholder box maintains the same aspect ratio as the product’s print area. (e.g., 4x6, 8x10, etc.).*

This ensures the design fits perfectly when rendered and reflects the actual product dimensions accurately.
**Once the placeholder box is positioned correctly, click Next to proceed.**

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_5)

Use the control options to adjust the placeholder box as needed (position, size, and rotation). Once you're satisfied with the placement, click the **Next** button to continue.

**Mask Area**

Use points and curves to accurately outline the printable area on the mockup.

* **Add Points** – Click to add anchor points on the image.
* **Add Curves** – Click to add curves between two points for smoother edges.
* **Undo** – Click to remove the last action.
* **Clear** – Click to remove all points and start over.
  ***Note:** Curves can only be added between two existing points.*


Once you’ve defined the mask area, click **Done** and save to save your changes.

* Test – To test the preview, choose an image and it will be uploaded.

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_12)


A crop window will appear. You can adjust the image using the mouse scroll wheel or the zoom in/out bar. After adjusting the image, click the **OK** button — it will redirect you to the product preview form’s test step.

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_1)


Now, click on the '**Generate Preview**' button. It will generate the preview using the uploaded mockup and the test image.

![](https://ezy-resources.s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/en/INTPGMKP_14)



A test product mockup will be generated with the test image. If it does not meet expectations, click on **'Previous'** to adjust the placeholder and mask area.

To save the product mockup, click on the **'Save’'** button.
