## **Overview**

This document outlines the steps to create a merchandise product in EzyCreate from start to finish. It includes definitions of key terminologies, preconditions, and a detailed, step-by-step process.

## **Key Terminologies**

* **Product Blank**: A foundational base item (e.g., mug, t-shirt) that includes only basic definitions such as dimensions and type. It does **not** include pricing, eCommerce configurations, templates, or designs.

  * Example: A standard 11oz mug with no associated template or sales info.
* **Product**: A market-ready version that includes all attributes necessary for selling, including pricing, eCommerce metadata, and at least one design template.
* **Product Types**:

  * **Customizable Product**: End users can personalize this using the design tool (e.g., add images, text).
  * **Merchandise Product**: Pre-designed product (e.g., branded merch) that may or may not allow image uploads.
* **Template**: A design layout applied to a product blank.
* **Template Group**: A collection of templates with similar designs, used to organize variants.
* **Variant**: A version of the product that varies by design, size, color, etc., within the same template group.
* **SKU (Stock Keeping Unit)**: A unique identifier for each variant.
* **Merch Album**: A group of pre-uploaded images used in product customization.
