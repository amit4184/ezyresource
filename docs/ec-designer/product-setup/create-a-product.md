## **SOP: Creating a New Product in EzyCreate**

**Overview**

This document outlines the steps to create a merchandise product in EzyCreate from start to finish. It includes definitions of key terminologies, preconditions, and a detailed, step-by-step process.

**Key Terminologies**

**Product Blank:** A foundational base item (e.g., mug, t-shirt) that includes only basic definitions such as dimensions and type. It does not include pricing, eCommerce configurations, templates, or designs.

Example: A standard 11oz mug with no associated template or sales info.

**Product:** A market-ready version that includes all attributes necessary for selling, including pricing, eCommerce metadata, and at least one design template.

**Product Types:**

**Customizable Product:** End users can personalize this using the design tool (e.g., add images, text).

**Merchandise Product:** Pre-designed product (e.g., branded merch) that may or may not allow image uploads.

**Template:** A design layout applied to a product blank.

**Template Group:** A collection of templates with similar designs, used to organize variants.

**Variant**: A version of the product that varies by design, size, color, etc., within the same template group.

**SKU** (Stock Keeping Unit): A unique identifier for each variant.

**Merch Album:** A group of pre-uploaded images used in product customization.
